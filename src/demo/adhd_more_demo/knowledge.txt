I. ADHD OVERVIEW
What is ADHD?

ADHD is one of the most common psychiatric conditions.
ADHD is commonly defined as a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental condition characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. It often carries on into adulthood.
65% of diagnosed children continue to have ADHD as adults.
There are three commonly diagnosed types of ADHD:

Predominantly inattentive:
Difficulty paying attention, forgetful, or easily distracted

Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type:
Fidgety, talkative, impatient behavior

Combined (inattentive/hyperactive-impulsive ADHD):
Shows symptoms of both
A family history of ADHD increases your risk
The exact cause of ADHD is still unknown. While environmental factors such as low birth weight, delivery complications, and exposure to toxins have been identified as potential causes, the biggest factor is genetic.

You have an estimated 75-90% chance of having ADHD if a member of your family has it
ADHD INTO ADULTHOOD
ADHD is a 24/7 disorder that often sticks around into adulthood

Can you outgrow ADHD?
It is widely accepted that ADHD is more common than previously thought; up to 65% of patients with childhood ADHD continue to have difficulties in adulthood.
Did you know ADHD is now recognized as one of the most common psychiatric diagnoses in adults with a prevalence of approximately 5% in the US?
That’s about 10 million diagnosed adults
ADHD symptoms often look different in adults than children
While symptoms of ADHD are the same throughout your life, they look different in adulthood. Many adults with ADHD are less likely to exhibit obvious hyperactive/impulsive symptoms. It is often more inattentive symptoms instead, especially in adult females.

DIAGNOSING ADULT ADHD
Many adults with ADHD remain undiagnosed

Just because you weren’t diagnosed as a kid, doesn’t mean you don’t have ADHD
Sometimes ADHD symptoms are overlooked in childhood, leading to a missed diagnosis. Knowing what symptoms to look for as an adult is key. Do any of the following sound familiar to you?
ADHD symptoms of inattention in adults
Careless mistakes: Do you have difficulty with detail, overlooking or missing mistakes at work? Or do you often get lost in the details?
Focus: Do you find it hard to focus during work, in conversations, or while reading something lengthy?
Poor listener: Are you often perceived as someone who doesn’t pay attention in conversations, even without any obvious distractions?
Following direction: Do you find that you fail to complete tasks at work or at home? Or do you tend to start a task and become easily side-tracked?
Staying organized: Do you struggle to stay organized at work or at home? Is time management or missing deadlines an issue for you?
Sustained interest: Do you struggle with tasks that require continued mental effort like completing forms or reviewing lengthy documents? Do you sometimes avoid those tasks? Or find that you will hyper focus on the wrong tasks?
Misplacing items: Do you often forget or misplace items of importance like your phone, wallet, or keys?
Easily distracted: Does your mind wander or drift to unrelated thoughts? Do you often find you have multiple thoughts at once or jump from thought to thought spontaneously?
Forgetful: Do you often forget to get back to people, or miss a bill or appointment?
ADHD symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity
Fidgety: Are you often tapping your hands or feet or find yourself unable to sit still?
Staying seated: Do you often find yourself wandering around when you should be at your desk, in a meeting, or seated at a social event?
Restlessness: Are excessive movement or feelings of restlessness an issue in your day to day? Is it hard to relax or do you struggle with sleep?
Being quiet: Is it hard for you to quietly engage in leisure activities?
Staying still: Are you often impulsively “on the go,” finding it uncomfortable to be still for an extended period of time at work or in a social setting like a movie? Have you ever been described as hard to keep up with?
Talkative: Do you find yourself talking excessively or too loudly at times?
Interrupting: Do you sometimes blurt out an answer before a question is even completed, or find yourself finishing people’s sentences?
Waiting your turn: Do you struggle with waiting in line or waiting for your turn at something?
Intruding on others: Do you ever interrupt conversations or find yourself taking over what others are doing without asking? Do you do these things impulsively?
Combined (inattentive/hyperactive-impulsive ADHD)
Do you show symptoms of both inattentive ADHD and hyperactive-impulsive ADHD?
See yourself in 5 or more symptoms in either of these categories? Consider talking to your doctor.
ADHD IN MEN VS WOMEN
ADHD can impact men and women differently

ADHD looks different in men than in women
The severity of hyperactive-impulsive symptoms tends be lower in women than in men. ADHD in men often looks more like the childhood symptoms of fidgeting, restlessness, or risk taking. Women, however, will more often show signs of inattention, which can be harder to spot.
Many girls and women remain undiagnosed, and as a result, are undertreated
Even in adulthood, women are more likely to be underdiagnosed because their ADHD symptoms can be overlooked and chalked up to just being disorganized, distracted, overwhelmed, or lacking motivation. Women with ADHD are more likely to report depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, and lower self-esteem which have similar symptoms to ADHD.

How much do you know about ADHD in women?
Common coexisting disorders can delay or confuse a diagnosis: Mood disorders, tics or involuntary actions, anxiety, substance abuse, and eating disorders are often accompanied by ADHD
Sleep issues: Not only are sleep disturbances common in ADHD, but they can be a sign of ADHD
Masking or overcompensating for symptoms is more common in women: For example, a busy mother ignoring her own symptoms in favor of caring for others
Self-reflection can help you see your ADHD more clearly
Talk to your friends and family about your symptoms for a more productive conversation with your doctor. In addition to your report of your symptoms, when possible, doctors will speak with people who know you well in helping assess your symptoms and reach an ADHD diagnosis.

IMPACT OF UNTREATED ADHD
ADHD can have a significant impact on your life
When adult ADHD goes unchecked, there can be serious consequences
ADHD impacts executive function – this includes control over your working memory, your ability to self-monitor, self-control, and to manage your time.
Adult ADHD often includes a wider spectrum of emotional dysregulation and functional impairment
Emotional dysregulation is a term used to describe an inability to regulate emotions and the responses to those emotions. It’s estimated to be found in 34-70% of adults with ADHD.
Emotional dysregulation can involve mood swings or severe depression and lead to high-risk behaviors or impulsivity.
Functional impairment is a term used to describe having a hard time performing everyday activities or difficulty working or keeping a job because of symptoms.
ADHD treatment can help improve these symptoms.
Untreated ADHD can lead to:

Work and finance issues
Frequent job changes/loss of employment
Productivity issues
Disorganization
Lower income
Less motivation to engage and follow up on important tasks

Relationship and social life strain
Symptoms can interfere with finding and maintaining social relationships
Marital problems
Increased risky behavior

Mental health and well-being struggles
Low self-esteem, which can delay personal growth
Increased anti-social acts
Avoiding seeking help due to the social stigma of ADHD
More substance abuse, suicide risk, and psychological and mood disturbances

If you think you have ADHD or your current treatment isn’t working, you have options

Talk to your doctor

Key Takeaways
ADHD is a 24/7 disorder that often sticks around into adulthood
Many adults with ADHD remain undiagnosed
When adult ADHD goes unchecked, there can be serious consequences
II. COMPLEX ADHD
There’s more to ADHD than you may think
Being an adult is hard. The complexities of ADHD can make it even harde
AN EVOLVING UNDERSTANDING
The understanding of ADHD has changed since you were a kid
Hyperactive-impulsive, inattentive, and combination ADHD looks different in adults than it does in children
Coexisting conditions complicate ADHD. Accompanying conditions can make life more difficult for those with ADHD. It is important to manage ADHD as well as other conditions that can intensify symptoms.
MOOD & PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS
Mood and psychiatric disorders are common, and often connected to ADHD

As many as 87% of adults with ADHD also have a psychiatric condition
Over 50% may have multiple psychiatric conditions
The most common coexisting conditions in adults with ADHD include:
Anxiety disorders: up to 50%
Bipolar: up to 47%
Depression: approximately 30%
Dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) is 6 times more likely to occur
Almost 100% of those with ADHD experience rejection sensitivity
Rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD) is characterized as extreme emotional sensitivity and pain that can mimic the above disorders. It’s characterized by sudden intense emotions, like going from feeling totally fine to extremely sad in a flash. Those with RSD are also known as “people pleasers” or perfectionists because of the pain of rejection.

Do you struggle to fall or stay asleep? Or find it difficult to wake up when you need to?
In clinical studies up to 80% of adults with ADHD reported sleep problems.
You’re not alone. ADHD doesn’t shut off when you go to bed. It’s a 24-hour-a-day condition. Adult patients with ADHD often have lower quality sleep, which leads to sleep debt.
This chronic lack of sleep not only amplifies other coexisting conditions like depression, but it also impacts your ability to take care of things at home or at work.
ADHD and sleep problems are both impacted in different ways by medications
For some patients on stimulants, insomnia, or delayed sleep is common.
COMPLICATING A DIAGNOSIS
Coexisting conditions can complicate an ADHD diagnosis
Many of the coexisting conditions listed above can mimic different symptoms of ADHD
The wrong treatments can mean the wrong outcomes for people with ADHD, depending on an actual diagnosis. Just treating a coexisting condition may not solve the underlying problem.
It’s important to have a discussion with your doctor about the relationship between coexisting conditions and ADHD, whether you’re currently diagnosed or not.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN ADHD
Substance abuse disorder can make living with ADHD more challenging
Did you know the risk for substance abuse disorder is double for those with ADHD vs those without?
Approximately 23% of adults with substance abuse disorder have ADHD. In particular, the rates of tobacco use, alcohol use, and marijuana use are higher.
Dopamine and ADHD
Dopamine plays a role in how we feel pleasure, and it plays a key role in the planning and initiation of motor responses, activation, and reward seeking.
In adults with ADHD, dopamine pathways may be dysfunctional, particularly during tasks that involve a lot of brain power.
There’s a link between the “ADHD brain” and the “substance use brain”
Evidence shows that patients with ADHD and substance use disorder share similar abnormalities in brain structure and function, particularly changes in dopamine involvement.
The connection to impulsivity, novelty seeking, or seeking “rewarding effects,” and why treating both ADHD and substance abuse disorder can be tricky.
Some ADHD medications have a potential risk of abuse
Stimulants increase levels of dopamine, which is how many drugs of abuse create the rewarding effects in your brain. They are schedule II-controlled substances and they are sometimes misused. They can also be addictive for adults with both ADHD and substance use disorder. You should share your history of substance use with your doctor to ensure you choose a safe treatment plan together.
SIDE EFFECTS IN DAILY LIFE
Some medications—and their side effects—can complicate your daily life
There are more options than ever to treat your ADHD, but some of them come at a cost
Appetite suppression: Not feeling hungry or finding you’ve missed meals
Sleep disturbances: Having a difficult time falling or staying asleep, or experiencing daytime sleepiness because of some medications
Drug interactions: Are you on other medications? Always check with your doctor for drug interactions before beginning a treatment
Family planning: Pregnant or breastfeeding women need to consider their options
Discomfort: Dry mouth, headaches, and anxiety can be triggered by some treatments
Keep track of any negative experiences you may have with any treatment

EVOLUTION OF TREATMENT
Because what is known about ADHD has changed, treatment approaches have also changed

There is no one-size-fits-all solution—everyone’s treatment plan is different
Your treatment needs change as you age. What worked for you as a kid may not work for you as an adult. Even if you’re not yet diagnosed, you’ll want to know about multimodal treatment – using a combination of treatment approaches to reach your personal needs.

Behavioral therapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy combines higher-level organization and planning, behavioral skills training, and cognitive restructuring (a technique that helps people change negative thinking patterns)

Psychotherapy: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) includes skills aimed at improving control over emotions and emotional distress, the ability to interact with others, and increased mindfulness

Stimulant and nonstimulant options: Stimulants have long been the standard treatment for ADHD but there are additional options, like nonstimulants, to consider
Key Takeaways
Hyperactive-impulsive, inattentive, and combination ADHD is not the same in children as it is in adults
Coexisting conditions can complicate an ADHD diagnosis
Some medications and their side effects can complicate daily life


III. ADHD TREATMENT
TREATMENT PLANNING
Looking to start or change an ADHD treatment?
Your ADHD treatment plan should be tailored to meet your needs and goals
SETTING YOUR GOALS
Your treatment needs may change over time
Are you getting what you want from treatment?

Your needs change as your life changes. Not all your symptoms look the same and not all symptoms need to be treated in any one way. Understanding your needs and making sure they’re being met is an important step in getting your treatment plan working for you.
Ask yourself these questions to help have a productive conversation with your doctor:
Have you always had a hard time focusing?
How are your relationships at work, at home, and socially?
Are you often accused of being “too loud” or of interrupting others?
Do you often feel sad or angry?
How’s your sleep? Do you find you are restless at night or can’t lay still long enough to fall or stay asleep?
Phone, wallet, keys? Do you often forget or misplace things?
Are you dependable? Do you struggle to complete tasks at home or at work?
How organized are you? Do you find cleaning and organizing to be overly stressful?
By answering these questions, you may identify some areas of your life to improve or symptoms you’re unhappy with. Take your list of concerns with you to your next doctor appointment.
ADHD TREATMENT OPTIONS
How much do you know about your treatment options?

There are more options now than ever before
It’s important to review all your options to see what’s best for your unique needs.
Multimodal treatment
ADHD symptoms are different for everyone. Make sure to tailor your approach with your doctor, and consider including counseling in addition to medication. The combination is thought to produce the best results in ADHD management.
Medications may play an important role in treating your inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity
There are 2 main categories of ADHD medications:
Controlled medications/stimulants
Noncontrolled medications/nonstimulants

Controlled medications/stimulants:
Contain the molecules methylphenidate or amphetamine.
Oldest class of ADHD medication
Works on the central nervous system to improve attention and reduce hyperactivity
Act fast, but symptoms may “rebound” (occur again) in the late afternoon or evening
Common side effects are loss of appetite, weight loss, and difficulty sleeping
Potential for abuse
Less common though more serious side effects include anxiety, heart complications, psychosis, and worsening of tics (involuntary actions)

Noncontrolled medications/nonstimulants:
Include certain classes of medications also used in other settings to lower blood pressure or adjust the chemicals in the brain (antidepressants).
May take a few weeks to be fully effective
Work differently than stimulants but may still help reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity
Not controlled substances, so monthly doctor’s appointments aren’t required for a refill
Have no potential for abuse compared to stimulants
Common side effects include mood changes and fatigue
Less common but more serious side effects include dizziness or drop in blood pressure
In rare cases, may cause liver problems

In the realm of Adult ADHD treatment, the landscape includes a range of pharmaceutical options beyond the well-trodden path of stimulant medications. Among these, four non-stimulant medications—Qelbree (viloxazine), Atomoxetine (Strattera), Guanfacine (Intuniv), and Clonidine (Kapvay)—present alternative or complementary strategies for managing ADHD symptoms. Each of these medications offers unique benefits and considerations, reflecting the personalized nature of effective ADHD treatment.

Qelbree (Viloxazine)
Qelbree represents a novel approach in the ADHD medication spectrum. As a non-stimulant option, it provides a unique mechanism of action that differentiates it from both stimulants and other non-stimulants. Approved for use in adults and children, Qelbree can be administered once daily, with or without food, and its side effects typically include insomnia, sleepiness, nausea, and dry mouth among others. It stands out for its ability to offer an alternative for those who may not respond well to or tolerate stimulant medications, illustrating the evolving landscape of ADHD treatment options.

Atomoxetine (Strattera)
Atomoxetine, known commercially as Strattera, targets the norepinephrine neurotransmitter system, providing a slow but steady improvement in attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity symptoms. Its distinction lies in its non-stimulant classification, reducing the risk of abuse while still offering significant benefits for ADHD management. Atomoxetine's side effect profile, including potential nausea and mood swings, emphasizes the need for a tailored treatment plan, underlining the importance of patient-provider collaboration in managing ADHD.

Guanfacine (Intuniv)
Guanfacine extends the ADHD treatment palette by offering a once-daily, non-stimulant option that modulates attention and behavioral impulses through its action on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. Particularly useful for individuals who experience adverse reactions to stimulants, Guanfacine’s side effects such as drowsiness and low blood pressure require consideration in treatment planning, showcasing the balance between efficacy and tolerability in ADHD medication management.

Clonidine (Kapvay)
Clonidine, under the brand name Kapvay, similarly operates within the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist category, providing a complementary or alternative option to traditional stimulant treatments. Its utility in addressing ADHD symptoms, often in combination with other medications, underscores the complex nature of ADHD as a condition that may necessitate a multifaceted treatment approach. The common side effects of drowsiness and dry mouth with Clonidine reflect the shared challenge of balancing symptom management with maintaining quality of life.

Integrating Non-Stimulant ADHD Medications

The inclusion of these four non-stimulant medications in the ADHD treatment arsenal expands the options available to individuals living with ADHD, offering hope and flexibility for those for whom stimulant medications are not suitable, effective, or preferred. The diversity in mechanisms of action and side effect profiles highlights the highly individualized nature of effective ADHD treatment. As research progresses and our understanding of ADHD deepens, the role of medications like Qelbree, Atomoxetine, Guanfacine, and Clonidine in providing tailored, patient-centric care becomes increasingly clear.

In essence, the journey through ADHD treatment is as diverse as the individuals it aims to assist. The array of non-stimulant medications available provides a beacon of hope for personalized treatment strategies, ensuring that each person with ADHD can find a path to symptom management that aligns with their unique needs and life circumstances. As the field evolves, so too will the strategies we employ, underscoring the dynamic and responsive nature of ADHD treatment in the quest for optimal health and well-being.

Combination therapy
If you’re only partially responding to your current treatment or experiencing disruptive side effects, talk to your doctor about combining stimulants and nonstimulants.
TALKING TO YOUR DOCTOR
The best treatment plans start with good doctor-patient relationships – knowing what to talk about is step 1

Whether you think you have ADHD or are on a treatment that just isn’t meeting your needs, ask yourself these questions to have a more productive conversation with your doctor
Here are some things to think about:
Are you currently on any medications?
What kind of symptoms are you experiencing?
Do you have issues with your current treatment plan?
Do you keep a log of your symptoms?
Is your current treatment meeting your needs professionally, socially, and with personal relationships?
Do you find you lose things, miss deadlines, or zone out?
You are your biggest advocate
Be kind to yourself–you are more than your current symptoms
Identify areas of improvement to share with your doctor
Understand your needs can and will change
Work with your doctor to set goals for yourself
Be open with your doctor about your ADHD
Here are some helpful tips to manage your ADHD
At home
Set reminders and stick to them: Be it on your phone, on a hanging calendar, or even post-it notes around the house, set reminders for everything and cross tasks off the list as you complete them
Everything in its place: Find a place for important items like your keys, gym bag, wallet, or computer bag and always return them after use so you don’t lose anything
Work to throw things out: Clutter can increase ADHD stresses. Clean out your bags, throw away stacks of unused items like magazines or old mail. Book time in your schedule and do a little every day so it doesn’t become overwhelming
At work
It’s OK to ask questions: Take note of your deadlines and make sure you understand directions, even if it means asking twice
Make things simpler for yourself: Arrange tasks into bulleted lists with clear directions for each step
Put a time limit on conversations that were meant to be quick: It’s easy to get lost on a call, keep it short and simple
Know your schedule: Check your agenda several times a day so you don’t forget a meeting or task
Ask for feedback: It’s OK to ask your supervisor or coworker how you’re performing so you know what to focus on
Working from home or remote schooling
Rethink your schedule: Breaks and meals are just as important to your workday structure as your meetings and tasks
Prioritize your tasks: Check in with your team or boss, make a list of what is due when, and stick to it
Home office: Carve out space just for work to help stay on task and to shut off when the workday is over
Do not disturb: Ensure everyone with you knows when you’re working so they aren’t tempted to distract you
In relationships
Schedule time for your relationship: Book time with your partner or friends, maybe a date or a movie so they stay a current priority
Look for better ways to communicate: Remember you’re on the same team. Work with your partner to find a way of communicating that works for both of you
Be compassionate: ADHD takes up a lot of mental and emotional space – pause and reset if you feel frustrated to avoid conflict
In social settings
Schedule social time into your life: As suggested for everything else, make plans and enter them into your calendar so you don’t miss out
Find a support group: Making friends as an adult can be hard, maybe even harder with ADHD, finding people to talk to can help
Check in with yourself: Impulsivity and emotional regulation are common traits for those with ADHD, take a breath
Ask for feedback: Similar to requesting feedback at work, asking friends and family how you’re coping with symptoms can help you find areas of improvement
