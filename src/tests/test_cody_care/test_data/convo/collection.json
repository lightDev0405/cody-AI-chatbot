These attributes contain information about how to generate a question from the corresponding field.\nThe attributes are:\n{'details of {chief complaint}': {'FIELD DATA ATTRIBUTES': 'To complete this Field, describe the Chief Complaint in detail. \\n\\n', 'EXAMPLES OF QUESTIONS': 'Please describe your {}. \\nWhat do you mean by {}\\nDescribe all you are experiencing with your { }', 'FIELD DATA ATTRIBUTE EXAMPLES': 'I am told I have worsening kidney function due to diabetes. \\nI have itchy skin and decreased urine '}, 'when started {chief complaint}': {'FIELD DATA ATTRIBUTES': 'To complete this Field, determine for how long your patient has experienced their Chief Complaint. \\n\\nDenote the duration in: hours, days, weeks, months, years', 'EXAMPLES OF QUESTIONS': 'When did you first start experiencing {}?\\nWhen did this current episode of {} start?', 'FIELD DATA ATTRIBUTE EXAMPLES': '2 years ago\\n2 weeks ago'}, 'previous medical diagnoses': {'FIELD DATA ATTRIBUTES': 'To complete this Field, determine if the patient has been diagnosed by a health professional with medical conditions.', 'EXAMPLES OF QUESTIONS': 'Have you been diagnosied by a health professional with any medical conditions?', 'FIELD DATA ATTRIBUTE EXAMPLES': 'Yes, I was diagnosed with Covid 19 twice since 2020.'}}\n\nUse this LIST OF FIELDS to select the next field to ask, based on the conversation history.\nSelect only one field from the list. Maintain the sequence of the fields.\nYour output should be a JSON with the following keys:\n\nthought: A few words, describing your thought process.\nfields_answered: list of strings (the fields that are already answered by the patient/user. Can be empty. Should be among ['details of {chief complaint}', 'when started {chief complaint}', 'previous medical diagnoses'])\nnext_field: string (the field selected to create the next question. Should be one among ['details of {chief complaint}', 'when started {chief complaint}', 'previous medical diagnoses'])\nquestion: string (The next question to ask regarding the next_field)\n\nNote:\n1. If the user responds to a field saying that they dont know, you should consider the field filled/answered.\n2. But if the user responds by asking a question or by responding in a way that doesnt make sense, you should consider the field not filled/answered.\n3. Your volcabulary of fields should only be among the list ['details of {chief complaint}', 'when started {chief complaint}', 'previous medical diagnoses'].\n4. DO not hallucinate or make up any information.\n5. If a field in ['details of {chief complaint}', 'when started {chief complaint}', 'previous medical diagnoses'] is filled, you should include it in the list of fields_answered.
