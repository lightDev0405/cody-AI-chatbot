      "content": "Ellie, here's what I've understood so far:\n- You have come to me regarding your faint line on pregnancy test.\n- You are 3 weeks late for your period.\n- You have been feeling sick but not actually vomiting.\n- You have been experiencing cramping for the past 3 weeks.\n- You had some brown discharge for a couple of days.\n- You have been producing more white discharge than usual.\n- You have been urinating more frequently than usual.\n- You have lost some weight and have been eating slightly more.\n- You have not had any previous pregnancies or miscarriages.\n- You have not had any recent changes in your sexual activity or contraceptive use.\n- You have not had any recent exposure to toxins or chemicals.\n\n\n\nBased on what you've told me, I've prepared your Top 3 Diagnosis List.\n\n1. Pregnancy (80% probability): The faint line on the pregnancy test, along with the missed period, increased urination, and changes in appetite and weight, suggest the possibility of pregnancy.\n\n2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) (60% probability): The increased frequency of urination and the presence of white discharge could be indicative of a UTI.\n\n3. Hormonal Imbalance (40% probability): The delayed period, cramping, and changes in appetite and weight could be caused by a hormonal imbalance.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and further guidance.\n\nI have prepared personalized treatment plans for you. If you would like to see a treatment plan, tell me the diagnosis or its number."
