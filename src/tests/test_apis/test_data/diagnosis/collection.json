Pregnancy (80% probability): The faint line on the pregnancy test, along with the missed period, increased urination, and changes in appetite and weight, suggest the possibility of pregnancy.\n\n2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) (60% probability): The increased frequency of urination and the presence of white discharge could be indicative of a UTI.\n\n3. Hormonal Imbalance (40% probability): The delayed period, cramping, and changes in appetite and weight could be caused by a hormonal imbalance.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and further guidance.\n\nI have prepared personalized treatment plans for you. If you would like to see a treatment plan, tell me the diagnosis or its number."
