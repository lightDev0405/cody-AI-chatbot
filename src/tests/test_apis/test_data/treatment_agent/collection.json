Infant Constipation (70% probability): Difficulty passing stools, hard and dry stools, straining during bowel movements, and bloated tummy are common symptoms of infant constipation. It is often caused by a lack of fiber in the baby's diet or dehydration.\n\n2. Gastrointestinal Infection (20% probability): Gastrointestinal infections can cause irregular bowel movements, discomfort, and pain during bowel movements. However, other symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, and fever are usually present as well.\n\n3. Milk Protein Allergy (10% probability): In some cases, babies can develop an allergy to proteins in breast milk, leading to digestive issues like constipation, bloating, and discomfort. Other symptoms like skin rashes or eczema may also be present.\n\nPlease consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nI have prepared personalized treatment plans for you.
